## Personal insights
Budgety is my first React app I have ever written by myself and I think a personal milestone in my fairly new developer career. I learned a lot, starting with routing through state management (with Redux), consuming API ending with Firebase. It was a huge amount of knowledge for me and it  definitely broadened my horizons. There were a plenty of challenges during development, but it gave me such satisfaction that it was definitely worth it!
